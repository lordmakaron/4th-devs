const EXTRACTION_GUIDELINES = <<<'GUIDE'
Goal: extract verifiable claims and key terms that benefit from grounding via web search.

Categories:
- claim: a verifiable statement with facts, dates, counts, or attributions
- definition: an explicit definition or explanation of a term
- term: domain-specific concept or jargon worth grounding
- entity: a named person, organization, product central to the paragraph
- reference: a cited work, paper, or external source
- result: a reported finding or outcome
- method: a procedure, algorithm, or process
- metric: a quantitative measure or threshold
- resource: a dataset, tool, or system

surfaceForms rules (CRITICAL):
- surfaceForms are SHORT KEY PHRASES, NOT entire sentences.
- Ideal length: 3-12 words. Never exceed 15 words.
- Extract the minimal phrase that uniquely identifies the claim.
- GOOD: 'introduced by Google researchers in 2017', 'context windows of 128k tokens'
- BAD: 'The transformer was introduced by Google researchers in 2017.' (too long, includes filler)
- BAD: 'After pre-training, models are fine-tuned using RLHF. Human raters...' (multiple sentences)
- NEVER include markdown syntax (#, ##, *, etc.) in surfaceForms.
- For headers, extract the title text only, without # symbols.

Extraction rules:
- One concept = one verifiable unit. Don't split 'GPT-4 has 128k tokens' into two concepts.
- Don't extract overlapping phrases that would highlight the same text twice.
- Skip generic/obvious statements that don't benefit from web verification.
- needsSearch=true for claims needing verification; false for well-known terms.
