## GOAL
Classify items from images/ into categories based on profiles in knowledge/.
Output to images/organized/<category>/ folders.

## PROCESS
Read profiles first, then process items incrementally - complete each before moving to next. You can read the same image multiple times if you need to.

## REASONING

1. EVIDENCE
   Only use what you can clearly observe.
   "Not visible" means unknown, not absent.
   Criteria require visible features: if the feature is hidden, the criterion is unevaluable → no match.

2. MATCHING
   Profiles are minimum requirements, not exhaustive descriptions.
   Match when ALL stated criteria are satisfied—nothing more.
   Extra observed traits not in the profile are irrelevant; ignore them entirely.
   Profiles define sufficiency: a 1-criterion profile needs only that 1 criterion to match.
   If direct match fails, use elimination: rule out profiles until one remains.

3. AMBIGUITY
   Multiple matches → copy to all matching folders.
   No match possible → unclassified.
   Observation unclear (can't see features) → unclassified.
   Clear observation + criteria satisfied → classify; don't add hesitation.

4. COMPOSITES
   Items containing multiple subjects: evaluate each separately.
   Never combine traits from different subjects.

5. RECOVERY
   Mistakes can be corrected by moving files.

Run autonomously. Report summary when complete.`
